### User Story:
As an expecting mother I want to register and have family members and friends determine the due date of the baby as well as the gender and weight.

## <a name="future-development"></a>Future Development
1. For future development we would like for this project to be able to connect to other social media.
2. We would like to incorporate baby-shower-games that can be played within the app.
3. Implement a automatic removal method of the users who's guess (on the baby's date of birth)was incorrect.
