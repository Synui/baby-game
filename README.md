## <a name="about-the-project"></a>About the Project
This project is to make pregnancy a little less stressful and a little more fun for the mother to be.  As a mom, you can register and have family members of friends login with mom's email as guests and connect with the mom's game.  The guests can play the guessing game and by the end of the pregnancy everyone who registered will be informed who the winner was.
  

### User Story:
As an expecting mother I want to register and have family members and friends play the guessing game in which  they guess the due date of the baby as well as the gender and weight.


## <a name="motivation"></a>Motivation
The motivation for this app is to benefit mothers so that their family members and friends can be involved in the guessing game.

1. We would like to incorporate more baby-shower-games that can be played within the app.
2. Implement a automatic removal of users with incorrect guesses.
