1. Add a like button capability on guests posts
2. Add a table that displays votes and users in ascending order by date and/or weight
3. Add a table that separates who voted for girl or boy
3. Make the voting card into a quiz like game instead of stationary form
Searchable “Find baby mama” if you don’t know her email address
4. Add an additional “suggest a name” field
5. Game option- competition. Place everyone’s votes by date. If your guessed date passed and baby wasn’t born, you are eliminated. If your guessed date comes after baby is born, you are eliminated.  If more than one guest guessed the right date, the elimination continues based on who is closest to the baby’s weight to find a winner.
